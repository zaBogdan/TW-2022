# Event handling 
Client A makes a request to endpoint `/listen/<companyId>` with the following request body

```json
{
    "event": "registeredUser",
    "userId": "8d190dc07a1c44829fb123ba233cb3ef"
}
```

Then in the backend we will do two things: 
- First check if the companyId exists
- Get information about the event (using event + companyId)
- Get information about the userId (using userId alone. If the user id doesn't exist in our database we will just create a new default user with that identification id)

Once everything is checked and fetched accordingly we will do the following:

1. Add the event to the user list and update user score
2. Push a task to the cron service to check wether we should combine the event with others and give more points to the user


# Microservices

### Gateway

The gateway microservice will be the one that will take all the load and forward the requests to the appropriate microservice

### Authentication

This microservice will handle all the authentication methods, at the starting point we will have only email & password. We will then give JWT access and refresh tokens


### Users service

This service targets the platform users (with editing accounts, profiles)

#### Gameify service (3x fiecare db are microserviciu lui)

This service targets all the logic behind gameification. Here we will point out the top features

- Adding a new domain (edit, delete, list - one/all)
- Adding a new event
- Adding a new achievement
- Listening to incomming events

### Evaluator service

With this service you will be able to evaluate the complex logic of each and every user. For example if we receive event `X` for user `Y` we will take all the rules in which event `X` is present and we will evaluate them using user `Y` data
